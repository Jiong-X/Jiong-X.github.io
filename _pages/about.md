I was born in Fujian, China. I came to Scotland to study for my undergraduate degree in 2021. I am a 4th year Cognitive Science student at the University of Edinburgh. 

We live in a complex and changing world, in which different entities interact with each other based on rules that are not directly observable to us.  To effectively interact with the world, we must (1)extract useful information about the world from limited observations and (2)use this information to guide our actions. The two processes, however, should not be treated as completely separate. Not only do our actions depend on the information we possess, but how we learn about the world is largely determined by the goal that we need to achieve. By using computational simulations, we might be able to analyse how intelligent systems interact with their environments given certain constraints. Answering these questions may bring us further understanding of what "mind" constitutes.
